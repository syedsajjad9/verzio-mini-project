                                <p class="card-text"> Amber Fort or Amer Fort is a fort located in Amber, Rajasthan, India. Amber is a town with an area of 4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi)[1] located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. Amber Fort is
                                    known for its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks Maota Lake,[2][3] which is the main source of water for the Amber Palace. Mughal architecture
                                    greatly influenced the architectural style of several buildings of the fort.[4][5][6] Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists
                                    of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by
                                    winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amber Fort is also popularly known as the Amber Palace.[3] The palace was the residence of the rulers and their families. At the entrance to the palace
                                    near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a goddess of the Chaitanya cult, which was given to Raja Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) in 1604.[2][7][8]
                                    Raja Man Singh had twelve queens so he made twelve rooms, one for each. Each room had a staircase connected to the king’s room but the queens were not to go upstairs. Raja Jai Singh had only one queen so he built one
                                    room equal to three old queen’s rooms. This palace, along with Jaigarh Fort, is located immediately above on the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) of the same Aravalli range of hills. The palace and Jaigarh Fort are considered
                                    one complex, as the two are connected by a subterranean passage. This passage was meant as an escape route in times of war to enable the royal family members and others in the Amer Fort to shift to the more redoubtable
                                    Jaigarh Fort.[3][9][10] Annual tourist visitation to the Amber Palace was reported by the Superintendent of the Department of Archaeology and Museums as 5000 visitors a day, with 1.4 million visitors during 2007.[1]
                                    At the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 2013, Amber Fort, along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the group Hill Forts
                                    of Rajasthan.[11]</p>
                                <p><b> Etymology</b> <br> Amber, or Amer, derives its name from the Ambikeshwar Temple, built atop the Cheel ka Teela. Ambikashwara is a local name for the god Shiva. However, local folklore suggests that the fort derives
                                    its name from Amba, the Mother Goddess Durga.[12]</p>
