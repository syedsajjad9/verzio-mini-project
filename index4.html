                                <p class="card-text"> Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the
                                    last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was life inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[1] It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal.
                                    The fort can be more accurately described as the walled city. Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud Ghaznavi's invasion is unclear. However in the 15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied
                                    it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487–1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat
                                    (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556–1605).</p>
                                <p><b> History</b> <br> After the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530.
                                    He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor
                                    to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.[2] Diwan-i-Aam, Hall of Public Audience Realising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian,
                                    Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan.[citation needed] Architects
                                    laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.[3][4] It was only during the reign
                                    of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings
                                    made from white marble. The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century.
                                    Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next
                                    decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803.[citation needed] The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion
                                    of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain.[citation needed] Scene of the gunpowder explosion at Agra Fort, 29 November 1871
                                    On 30 November 1871 thirty six people died when the Cartridge factory exploded.[5]</p>
